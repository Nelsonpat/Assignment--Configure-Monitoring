Configure monitoring for AWS compute and storage 

Instruction

**Configure monitoring for AWS compute and storage** 

**Problem Statement:**

The rapid adoption of cloud technology has revolutionized the way organizations manage and store their data. However, with the increasing complexity and scale of cloud environments, there is a growing challenge to ensure optimal performance, cost efficiency, and security. As cloud infrastructures expand, monitoring becomes crucial to address specific limitations and potential risks.

The specific problem that needs to be addressed is the lack of comprehensive monitoring for AWS EC2 and Storage services. Due to the dynamic nature of cloud environments, organizations face difficulties in tracking and analyzing key performance metrics, leading to potential consequences such as increased operational costs, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities. Without efficient monitoring, it becomes challenging to identify performance bottlenecks, resource wastage, or potential security threats, which can impact the overall reliability and performance of the cloud infrastructure.

**Objectives:**

The objective of this project is to understand the importance of monitoring AWS EC2 and Storage services for performance, cost efficiency, and security. By learning about AWS monitoring tools and configuring comprehensive monitoring, we aim to proactively detect and address performance issues, ensure high availability, and implement security monitoring. The project will focus on receiving timely alerts, optimizing resource utilization, and utilizing monitoring insights to enhance overall cloud environment performance and security.

Your focus in this project should be on the following:

-  Learners should grasp the importance of monitoring AWS EC2 and Storage services to ensure optimal performance, cost efficiency, and security in cloud environments.
- gain familiarity with various AWS monitoring services and tools available for tracking performance metrics and security events.
- Focus on setting up and configuring comprehensive monitoring for EC2 instances and storage services, ensuring real-time insights into resource utilization and health status.
- Focus on designing monitoring solutions for high availability and resilience to ensure continuous monitoring support.
- Utilize monitoring insights to optimize resource utilization, reduce costs, and improve overall cloud infrastructure efficiency.
- Apply monitoring insights to enhance cloud environment performance and security, making informed decisions and improvements.
